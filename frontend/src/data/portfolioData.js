    bio: "Hi, I'm Abhay Singh, a Data Scientist and Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building scalable web applications and intelligent AI systems. I recently completed my BSc in Data Science from IIT Madras, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning, web development, and software engineering. I have worked on projects involving Flask, FastAPI, React, and cloud-based applications, and I enjoy bridging the gap between data-driven models and user-facing products. My experience spans from teaching and mentoring students in ML to building real-world projects like a GenAI Academic Assistant and a Household Services App. I'm passionate about solving problems with data, AI, and scalable backend systems, and I aim to build products that create real-world impact."
